        <h3>Cases & Get Shit Done</h3>
        <h4>Duplicate code (Laravel Framework)</h4>
        <p>Two laravel applications made the same query to mysql database, the same code was repeated in both.<br/><br />

        To solve the repeated code, I had to create a repository in git and add the part of the two repeating applications. Once the repository was created, I added it to both as git-submodule.</p>
